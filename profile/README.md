# GirlsCode

GirlsCode is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering young women through technology education and job placement. Our mission is to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry by providing training and mentorship to girls who are interested in pursuing careers in coding.

## What We Do

We recruit talented young women from diverse backgrounds and provide them with comprehensive training in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript. Our curriculum includes hands-on projects, coding challenges, and real-world applications to ensure that our students have the skills they need to succeed in the tech industry.

Once our students complete their training, we work with partner organizations to place them in internships or full-time positions. We also provide ongoing mentorship and support to help our graduates thrive in their new roles.

## How You Can Help

We rely on donations from individuals and organizations to fund our programs and provide housing for our students during their training. If you're interested in supporting GirlsCode, please visit our website at [www.girlscode.co.za](https://www.girlscode.co.za) to learn more about how you can get involved.
